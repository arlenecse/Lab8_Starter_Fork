Please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 

Graceful degradation is defined as the designing of computer and network system so that they can function even if certain components fail, such as network connection. Service workers help improve reliability by allowing websites to have offline access. Therefore, we can implement graceful degradation by using service workers when the network fails and switch to offline access so that the website can continue functioning even without a connection.
